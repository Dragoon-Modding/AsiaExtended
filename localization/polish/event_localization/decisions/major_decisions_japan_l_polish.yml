# Forming the Kamakura Shōgunate

 japan_decisions.0001.desc:0 "For generations, we of the Minamoto clan have had our ambitions constrained by the whims of the Imperial Court in Kyoto. Yet as their authority continues to wane across the country, the illusion of their unchallenged dominance has increasingly been called into question. Our recent triumphs over our rivals and the consolidation of power have convinced most that we Minamoto are the true power behind the Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\nNow, from my stronghold in Kamakura, far from the influence of the Imperial Court, I have assumed the title of Shōgun, Supreme Commander of the Realm, bestowed upon me by the Emperor himself. Yet it is not the court but the sword that shall secure order in the land. This shift marks the dawn of a new age, where the samurai will uphold order and harmony across Japan. The Emperor remains the spiritual heart of our nation, but true authority now rests in the hands of the Shōgun."
 japan_decisions.0001.a:0 "Iza Kamakura!"

With the Emperor’s formal recognition, the head of the Minamoto clan has assumed the title of Shōgun, governing the realm from his fortress in Kamakura, removed from the influence of the Imperial Court.\n\nThis shift marks the dawn of a new age, where the samurai will uphold order and harmony across Japan. The Emperor remains the spiritual heart of Japan, but true authority now rests in the hands of the Shōgun."
